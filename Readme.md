Toledo1 is an LLM browser where the URL points to LLM inference, a direct chat line to any LLM on the public internet, private cloud, or local desktop running OpenAI compatible inference. A paradigm shift in web search, where users pay per query with confidentiality. Its real-time capability to chain multiple models on context using presets makes it a [manual compound AI system](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), a truth machine.
